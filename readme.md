Backend:

1. Clone backend repo.
2. Install all required libraries using `npm install` if you are using node package manager.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. Inside the file add the following:

   ```

   # Secret tokens for JWT
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=YOURSECRETKEYFORACCESSTOKEN
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=YOURSECRETKEYFORREFRESHTOKEN

   # indicate in seconds.
   REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=ANYNUMERICALVALUEBIGGER e.g. 3600
   ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFESPAN=ANYNUMERICALVALUEBIGGER e.g. 300

   # Uncomment this if you are not connected to default mongodb
   # database, "mongodb://localhost:27017/project3Database".

4. `npm run dev` to launch application if you have nodemon installed globally; else use `npm run start`.

## Project Description

### Requirements/Inputs Gathering:

1. **User stories** were developed in early project stage to describe important features to be included in the project.

   - User Story 1: : As someone who is busy and like to attend events, I would like to browse all events in one place and add my favourite events that is viewable in calendar.

   - User Story 2: As a user, I would like to have a carousel showing "highlighted" events.

   - User Story 3: As an admin of the application, I would like to make changes to the database so that the application can continue to provide relevant content to the users.

2. Translation of user stories into **Main Features** that our web application should have:

   - Carousel to display "highlighted" events.

   - Display all events with key details.
   - Modal to show full event details, when click on carousel or event card.
   - Form to create a new user account and login.
   - Function for user to add favourite events into their calendar.
   - A calendar to display all usersâ€™ favourite events.
   - Admin access to create, remove, or update events.
   - Data persisted in database.
   - Authentication to access protected APIs routes.

JWT Authentication:

- Authentication is done at backend using JWT access token.
- Upon login, access and refresh tokens will be issued. These tokens are then stored in "state" of frontend app.
- Every request made to protected APIs require access token which is stored in Authorization Header of request object in "bearer token" format.
- Typically, access token has much shorter life span than refresh token. If expired, refresh token can be used to get new access token. If refresh token is expired, access to protected APIs would be forbidden and relogin is required.
- With Axios request interceptor, before any request to protected APIs is sent, interception is made to check the expiration of access token. If expired, new access token would be obtained using refresh token. Subsequently, request to protected APIs is sent with new access token. All these process are done using the same instance of Axios.

### Area of Improvement:

- Web app to be responsive e.g. mobile, tablet etc.
- Allow user to reset password.
- Add search bar, event filtering and sorting bar.
- Allow user to add review or comments to every event.
- Expand more functions like allow to buy tickets.
- Allow user to submit new events for Admin to review.
